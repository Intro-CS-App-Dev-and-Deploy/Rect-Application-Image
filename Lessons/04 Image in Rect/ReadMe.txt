Note: too many old algorithms in here

Clean this up to see only one algorithm

Note: some rect() variables might be 0.0 due to population being too low in the flat program
- Might need to move the population to underneith the display algorithm (this is the reason it is added at the end of the program)







Introduce Procedural Programming here, and passing values, if come poeple in class are advanced enough

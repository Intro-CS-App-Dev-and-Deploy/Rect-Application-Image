Algorithm works when image is larger than CANVAS, not smaller

If this algorithm exists only, then maximum grade is 65% for this algorithm

Purpose: aspect ratio uses larger dimension to stretch if CANVAS is larger, then calculate appropriate stretch of smaller dimension
- Note: if larger dimension is stretched, then the calculated dimension must be smaller than the CANVAS to fit properly

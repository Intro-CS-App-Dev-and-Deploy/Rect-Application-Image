CAUTION: read the 05 CLean Algorithm first and work backwards
- breaking variables is a good way to emphasize meaning
- first time through, single-line-IFs with Booleans
- second time through, two IF-Else's with Booleans
- third time throgh, one IF-Else coped with changing alpha numeric values and referenced rect() layout parameters


Lessons should begin with flowcharts of larger dimension image stretch and shrinking





Image stretch to the background is one algorithm

Image inside rectangles would be shrinking algorithm

The purpose of all lessons is to combine algorithms to answer following questions
- Canvas will hold entire image
- Aspect Ratio can be used if needed, but known to be rare (so centering and filling rectangle background is necessary)


CAUTION: final lesson is introduction to procedure with values passing

Lessons should begin with flowcharts of larger dimension image stretch and shrinking





Image stretch to the background is one algorithm

Image inside rectangles would be shrinking algorithm

The purpose of all lessons is to combine algorithms to answer following questions
- Canvas will hold entire image
- Aspect Ratio can be used if needed, but known to be rare (so centering and filling rectangle background is necessary)


CAUTION: final lesson is introduction to procedure with values passing
